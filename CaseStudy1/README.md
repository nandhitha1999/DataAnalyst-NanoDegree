## CASE STUDY 1 - WINE QUALITY ASSESMENT
The original dataset was got from here [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality]


**ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION:**

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

**QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED:**

* number of samples in each dataset

* number of columns in each dataset

* features with missing values

* duplicate rows in the white wine dataset

* number of unique values for quality in each dataset

* mean density of the red wine dataset

* Based on histograms of columns in this dataset, which of the following feature variables appear skewed to the right? Fixed Acidity, Total Sulfur Dioxide, pH, Alcohol

* Based on scatterplots of quality against different feature variables, which of the following is most likely to have a positive impact on quality? Volatile Acidity, Residual Sugar, pH, Alcohol

* Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?

* What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?

* Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?

* Do sweeter wines receive higher ratings?

* What level of acidity receives the highest average rating?
