# FUEL ECONOMY 
The fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle. Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.

* source2 - https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml/

**Questions to check the dataset:**

* number of samples in each dataset

* number of columns in each dataset

* duplicate rows in each dataset

* datatypes of columns

* features with missing values

* number of non-null unique values for features in each dataset

* what those unique values are and counts for each


**Questions to gain insights about the dataset:**

Q1: Are more unique models using alternative fuels in 2018 compared to 2008? By how much?

Q2: How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy (increased in mpg)?

Q3: What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time? (mpg, greenhouse gas)

Q4: What features are associated with better fuel economy (mpg)?

Q5: For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced in 2018, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
