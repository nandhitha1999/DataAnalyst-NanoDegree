# PROJECT 5 - Communicate Data Findings

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. 

**Exploratory data visualization** generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. 

**Explanatory data visualization** techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.


## Dataset 
**Udemy Courses Dataset**

The analysis was performed for the examination of the Udemy Courses dataset, an e-learning platform that provides a variety of courses in various domain for free as well as for paid.It has nearly 3678 course related listings in the dataset with 12 variables. 

## Summary

* In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the learners and the free courses and also between the Web development courses and learners.

*  It is seen that learners are more prone to enrol in free courses. If they opt to choose paid courses, the prefer to ivest in courses having low prices than the expensie ones.

* Also, learners utilize the online course platform to develop their web development skills mostly, and also other technology related courses rather that others.

* The website has more reviews for free courses than the reviews for the paid courses.

* The creation of new technologies courses was many in number in the year 2016 compared to other years, this may be due to the online learning culture among learners.

* The cost of a course on Udemy ranges from 20 USD to nearly 90 USD. And also courses on Web development seem to have the largest interquartile range where courses on musical instruments has the least


To conclude this analysis , I say that Web development field is in need for skilled people and so people opt to seek opportunities that will help them.

Key Learnings from the project:

- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.

- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.

- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
