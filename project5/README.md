# PROJECT 5 - Communicate Data Findings

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. 
- **Exploratory data visualization** generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. 

- **Explanatory data visualization** techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

Key Learnings from the project:

- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.

- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.

- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
