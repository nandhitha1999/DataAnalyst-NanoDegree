# A/B TESTING

A/B tests are used to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a control group sees the old version, while the experiment group sees the new version. A metric is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other. A/B testing is very much like hypothesis testing with the following hypotheses:

* **Null Hypothesis**: The new version is no better, or even worse, than the old version

* **Alternative Hypothesis**: The new version is better than the old version

If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, the results would suggest keeping the old version. If we reject the null hypothesis, the results would suggest launching the change. These tests can be used for a wide variety of changes, from large feature additions to small adjustments in color, to see what change maximizes your metric the most.

A/B testing also has its drawbacks. It can help you compare two options, but it can't tell you about an option you haven’t considered. It can also produce bias results when tested on existing users, due to factors like change aversion and novelty effect.

* **Change Aversion**: Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the old version, simply because they are unhappy with change, even if it’s ultimately for the better.

*  **Novelty Effect**: Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the new version, because they’re excited or drawn to the change, even if it isn’t any better in the long run.
