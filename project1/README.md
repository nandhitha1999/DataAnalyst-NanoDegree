## PROJECT 1 - EXPLORING WEATHER TRENDS

*GOAL: The goal is to create a visualization and to prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between the global temperature trends and the temperature trends of a city.*

* Extraction of data : Extract the required information from the database.
  The Database Schema:
  There are three tables in the database:

    city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
    city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
    global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
 
 * Download CSV : Open the CSV to view the data and perform required pre-processing. Calculate the moving average inorder to plot and understand the trendline.
 * Create plot : Creation of lineplots that compare city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. The plot is created using the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable
 * Observations : Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
    
    Some of the questions to be asked are:
    * Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
    * How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
    * What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
