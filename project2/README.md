## Analyse a dataset - IMDb DATASET

I chose to use the IMDb Dataset obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
● Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. 
● There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is. 
● The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time. 

**List of questions queried on the dataset:**
  * What is the most popular genre with which movies are made?
  * How many movies ended up in profit? And how many were in loss??
  * Does the budget or the release date/year or the popularity or the runtime or the vote average or the combination of all influence the movie's outcome?
  * Is it possible to visualize the ratio of high budget movies to low budgets?
  * What will be the number of latest movies included in the dataset?
  * Who might be the most popular or frequently casted actor?
  * Which movie made the highest profit and which made the lowest profit of all?


Feel free to update me on mistakes or any improvements that can be done to enhance the insights obtained from the dataset.
**Thank You**
